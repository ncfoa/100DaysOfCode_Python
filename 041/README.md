# 100 Days of Code

###Personal webpage Setup
The next severa lessons will include webscraping and other 
HTML related Python apps, so the instructor of the course I'm
folowing has included a couple of basic HTML and CSS tutorials.
While it's not Python, it is coding. I'm hoping for Python 
associated with HTML in the not too distant future.

####Course day covers: 
Basic HTML boilerplate for html5

Formatting with `<strong>/</strong>` and `<em></em>` over `<b></b>` and `<i></i>`

Ordered/Unordered lists`<ul><li></li></ul>` and `<ol><li></li></ol>`

Image Tags
`<img src="" alt="" />` 

Anchor Tags
`<a href="" alt="">`

###For these exercises I am using:
 [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my IDE. 
 Instructor suggested using [atom](atom.io) as her choice for the class.
