# 100 days of code Udemy Python

## Note on code here:
While I wrote the code on this page, I originally used static 
values in a .json file to work with the flight API. I do not 
like the idea of using an API that requires Credit Card info
for a free feature. I modified it to be like the ending code
from the course work but, I have not actually tested the flight
searching portion.

###APIs used are:
Google Sheets interface/modification: 
[Sheety](https://api.sheety.co/) 

Flight Search information:
[Kiwi](https://tequila-api.kiwi.com)

SMS Service is provided by:
