# 100 Days of Code Python

## Creating a RESTful API
This particular course revolved around the earlier example for 
the cafe rating app. I honestly did not want to create such a boring
API, so I decided that instead of Cafe's I am going to use [George Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin)
quotes for my database. I've amassed quite a few over the years and
will now put them into good use. 

If you do not know who George Carlin was, then you are probably too 
young to use my API. He was one of the best commedians of his time. 
There is not a single one of his shows I haven't seen.

I will not upload my full datafiles to Github. I have 2 reasons:
1. While this is an example of a REST api, I may decide to host this myself somewhere. 
2. The language used by George is at times very colorful, I don't intend to censor it in any way.

## For the sake of completeness of the course
I decided to complete the cafe API for the sake of completeness of 
the course. My luck, they will want to use the API somewhere down the line.
