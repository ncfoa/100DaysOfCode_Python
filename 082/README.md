# 100 Days of Code Python

## Professional Portfolio Project

### Portfolio Website
For this day of course, the instructor has requested a website
to house your porfolio projects. While I don't feel this particular
project has anything to do with Python itself, I relented and
created a nice porfolio website. I wasn't going to publish it
on the web, but I have a domain name just sitting around not in use, 
so it'll be [here](https://hitekredneck.io) if anyone wants to see
it.
