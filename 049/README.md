# 100 Days of Code Python

### LinkedIn Job search automation
This code will log into your [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) account and scrape data from
the job postings and save the information to a JSON file under the
date/time of the scrape. The class called for automating applying
for a job through the LinkedIn Job Postings but I currently do not
wish to do that.  This is my compromise on what the course has asked.
