# 100 Days of Code

###Personal webpage Setup
The next several lessons will include webscraping and other 
HTML related Python apps, so the instructor of the course I'm
folowing has included a couple of basic HTML and CSS tutorials.
While it's not Python, it is coding. I'm hoping for Python 
associated with HTML in the not too distant future.

####Course day covers: 
hmtl forms `<form></form>`

html tables `<table><tr><td></td></tr></table>`



###For these exercises I am using:
 [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my IDE. 
 Instructor suggested using [atom](atom.io) as her choice for the class.
