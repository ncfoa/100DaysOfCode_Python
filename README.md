# 100DaysOfCode_Udemy course by Angela Yu from London App Brewery

Just brushing up on my Python coding...

Companion work that follows Angela Yu's Python 100 days of code course on Udemy. Modified with my own interpretations on how things should be done in some places.

I am utilizing the Pycharm IDE with Python 3.8 on my local machine (Macbook Pro). Some courses required modifying HTML and that just doesn't feel right in Pycharm so I did use VSCode for that portion.
