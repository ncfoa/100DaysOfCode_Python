# 100DaysOfCode_Python

The code in this folder modifies code previously in lesson 
[017](https://github.com/dbeidle/100DaysOfCode_Python/tree/main/017).
The idea behind it is to turn the quiz that was in 017 
into a GUI quiz game. Usually, I would just modify the source project
and update it but I like having both versions around so thus, here is
the GUI version.

Have a go at it if you like. Both of them are pretty neat projects.
