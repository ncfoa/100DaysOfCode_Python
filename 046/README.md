# 100 days of code Python day 46

Create [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) playlist by scraping 
data from the [Billboard Top 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100)
charts for a specific year. 

You will need to create a .env file in the project directory
to add your Spotify_ID and Spotify_Key. It works as per the 
instructions for the class but does not do the best job, and
I'm quite sure that the instructor didn't get as many hits as
I've been able to.
