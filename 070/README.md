# 100 Days of Code Python

### Day 70 -  Deploying to Heroku
Today's course was all about how you can deploy your site to
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). I don't personaly use Heroku
for any of my projects as I have an old desktop running [Ubuntu-Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
as the OS and it gives me a Production Environment that is always
live and accessible. No waiting for a 3rd party to spin up your
applications to serve your site.  With that said, I have no need
to host a blog site as I have already built a blog using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
and [React](https://reactjs.org/). I have the ability to log in users
from either their Google account, Facebook account, or a local database 
of users who can sign up with email/password. 

What that means. I am not uploading the blog project anywhere online. I
have absolutely no need except to show off that the code works. I know 
it works as I have been coding it.
