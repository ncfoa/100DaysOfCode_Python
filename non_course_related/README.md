# 100 Days of Code Python

This directory holds files that I have created that were not
originally part of the course that I have been working on. 
I've built these files to aid me in my life as a developer or
associated with work items to make things flow smoother.

### directory_traversal.py Day 6 of 100
This particular script I created to go down the rabbit hole of
my hard-drive to look for any image files and parse them to an 
output I could use for a static file I was using with my website.

### subnet_calc day 18 of 100
I created this code because there are tons of times I have needed
a subnet calculator in my work day life. Fairly simple use of the
ipaddress python module.

### weather.py Day 5 of 100
I built this particular script to just have fun coding something
that did not require a class or tutorial to build. Came out pretty
good I think. 

### imperva_csv_parser.py Day 33 of 100
This code I have re-written from a script that I utilize for work
related activities. It will take a CSV Report of Blocks performed
by an Imperva WAF and parse it down to the top 100 blocks with
the whois information associated. This shaves 2 hours or more
off a current manually performed task. If you want to test this
script, you will need to buy an Imperva WAF and have it provide
you with the file. Unfortunately, I can't provide a starting example
without breaking PII codes of conduct.
