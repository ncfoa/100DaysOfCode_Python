#100 Days of Code Python

I deviated from the course on this particular project. 
If I wanted to learn any language it would have to be Japanese. 
The course was based on French being the language to learn. 

I pulled down the base 10,000 Kanji, Katakana, and hirigana from the
[wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Japanese)
frequency list. I then ran them through a Google Sheet and 
was able to isolate down those words and export them as CSV. 
I then used an API to pull down the Romaji through another
API that for the life of me I can't find since I only used it 
once then deleted it from the code base. If I remember it or 
find it, I'll modify this file to give credit where it's due.
