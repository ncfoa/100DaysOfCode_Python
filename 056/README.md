# 100 Days of Code Python

## Serving static websites with Flask
These projects are very simplistic in their nature. 

### Static HTML
The code in static_html is the same as was in the day 44 course. The 
only difference is we are serving the site with Flask as opposed
to opening the index.html directly in the browser. 

### Business Card
The code within the business_card directory has a bit more 
complexity in it and provides a wonderful view of an online
"Business Card" and again, served by Python Flask as a server.
