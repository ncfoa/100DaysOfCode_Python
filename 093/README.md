#100 Days of Code Python

## webscraper
The instructions for this day was to create a custom webscraper 
to pull info for something that interests me. I have a particular
fondness for Firefly(tv show)/Serenity(movie).  I created a simple
webscraper to pull down quotes from the show from the firefly.fandom.com wiki.
