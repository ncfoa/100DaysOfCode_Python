# 100 Days of Code Python

## Post to Facebook and Twitter Bot
The course work for this particular instance had a task of 
checking your internet speed with [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) and posting to Twitter if your 
speed was less than promised. While I don't personally have any
internet speed issues (thank you [AT&T Fiber](https://att.com)), I decided
to take this in a different direction. I have created a bot to
take in a message from me and have it post to both my [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com)
feeds. Automating this with Facebooks API makes this impossible. 
Selenium gives me back the control.
