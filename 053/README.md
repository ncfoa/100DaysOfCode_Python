## Zillow apartment hunting app w/Google Forms
This app will browse [Zillow](https://zillow.com) and parse the
data into a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/)
This would make apartment hunting 75% easier as a user would not
have to search through on their own to find apartment listings.
You would need a link to Zillow with all the parameters of your 
search already in it. I placed mine in the .env file only because
it was the only file I had open after doing the initial lookups
to get the data I wanted for the files.  

## Zillow apartment hunting app with output to CSV
This one is pretty much the same as the above except I used
the Pandas library to put the information on my hard-drive in CSV
form.
