# 100DaysofCode_Python Day 30

The Day 30 class was on implementing Error handling into 2 existing projects. I will list them below. 

While I could have just implemented them in this folder, I felt that it was best to update the existing repo with the current files. You can look at the changelog to see the modifications made.
