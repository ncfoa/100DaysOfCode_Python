### Morse Code converter
This particular piece of code is just converting text over to 
Morse Code and providing the output. Very simple to create. Hardest
part was finding a good source of translations. I used the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) 
entry for Morse code to pull the respective entries. My code only
utilizes "A-Z", ".", and "?". It will error if you try to use
any other values.
