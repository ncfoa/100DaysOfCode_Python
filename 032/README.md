# 100 Days of Code

The projects in this directory are from the day 32 course on 
Udemy. Both files work off of data that needs to be edited in
their respective json files. 

## birthday_mail
``edit file ./birthday_mail/birthdays.json to hold data for 
your needs. ``

## monday_inspirational_quote
``edit file ./monday_inspirational_quote/quotes.txt to hold 
any quotes that you wish to add or remove.``

### Both files can be automated with the use of crontab on 
linux devices or through a service like [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
with relative ease. If you have access to a linux device, I 
would suggest going that route with it as you can automate
as many scripts as you want for free if it's your own machine 
or just on top of whatever you may be paying for a service. 
[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) has a free
tier but only allows for one script to be automated at a time.
