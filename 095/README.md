#100 Days of Code Python

## Automate something in my daily life. 
This day's project was to automate something you do in your
daily life. I personally check my websites to see if they
are working by opening them up in a browser window. 

I decided to automate the checking and verification on if my 
websites online are returning a 200 status code. If not then
an email will be sent to me to notify me to check the server.

Create a json file named sites_to_check.json and create an 
array for the sites you wish to check. If you are unfamiliar
with JSON use the following as an example:

`["https://google.com", "https://yahoo.com"]`

You will also need to create a .env file that will hold your
email username, email password, and the address you want to 
send to.
