### Number guessing game with Flask
This is a number guessing game with Flask. I have made a slight 
adjustment to my .env file for this one. In your env file add
the following two lines:

`FLASK_APP=main.py`

`FLASK_ENV=development`


Once those are in you can start the flask dev server. Either
in pycharm with the run button or in your cli with `flask run`
Either way you get the server started is up to you. Then point
your browser to `https://localhost:5000/` and start the game.
